# Limitation
## 1. Only 3 kinds of Coffee Green beans among 14 can be classified
    - Normal, Broken, Black
## 2. In order to use the logdata predicted, It is still necessary to label the logdata
## 3. We need another skill to integrate the several procedures into one fully-automated process
## 4. the bean which has more than 2 kinds of defect at once must be considered
## 5. Some errors when objects are detected
## 6. Only one side of Green bean can be detected.

# Extensibility
## 1. Model update
    - Loss function can be tunned for the model oriented to Normal classification
    - Neural network layer can be customized
    - Ratio of Trainning data cound be adjustable
## 2. Model upgrade
    - Obtaining 14 kinds of coffee green bean data
## 3. Modification of the Model to Binary Classification Model
    - Optimization of Precision for 100%
    - Coffee roasters can be free for hand-picking process at least about the Normal coffee beans
## 4. Making A Machine
